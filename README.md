## What I learned in this handson: 

Through this handson, I learned the basics of using Docker to deploy a Python Flask web application with a Redis cache and to run a PostgreSQL database. I also learned how to debug and troubleshoot code using the command line and interpret the error messages provided by Docker. I learned the different files required to run in Docker beyond the app itself and how the files interact and depend on each other. Finally, I grew more familiar with how containerization appears in the Docker desktop app
